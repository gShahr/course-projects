# Custom Character driver Project
---
### 1st stage: Implement black-box tests that specify driver behavior
* Mandatory: `read(2)`, `write(2)`
* Highly recommended: `ioctl(2)`
* Recommended: `llseek(2)`

Any interesting and creative behavior is encouraged

---

### 2nd stage: The meat
* Implement the driver as specified by your tests
* Prepare a 10-15 minute presentation

Submit each stage as pull requests to this repository!
